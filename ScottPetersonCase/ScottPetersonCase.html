&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott Lee Peterson was born October 24,1972 in San Diego, California. He is known for the murder of his eight-month pregnant wife laci in 2002. Peterson has been charged for first degree murder of Laci and second degree murder of his unborn son Conner. For this action he was sentenced to death by lethal injection in 2004.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Early Life</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Scott was a only child of Lee and Jackie Peterson. Both his parents did have other children from previous relationship. As a young boy Scott grew up in San Diego who had a passion for golf. Later he attended Arizona State University for one semester but then he wanted to transferred to a nearby school close to home. In 1994 he joined Polytechnic State University, where he majored in agriculture business. That is where he met Laci and got married in 1997.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Death of Laci and Conner</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Both families of Laci and Scott were anxiously waiting for the birth of Conner Peterson on February 10 2003. According to </span><span class="c3">Scott&rsquo;s sister, Susan Caudillo said, &ldquo;She and Scott were thrilled about the coming of a baby boy&rdquo;. </span><span class="c0">But there was a change of plan when Laci was reported missing in Modesto, California on December 24, 2002.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some believe that Scott strangle and killed Laci on the 23th in their house but others said that she went missing while walking the dog. It wasn&#39;t until April of 2003 when Scott was arrested when the police officer found Laci&rsquo;s body by the shore of San Francisco Bay. On September 26, 2003 Laci&rsquo;s family filed a lawsuit toward Scott to prevent him from receiving money if he sold his story. After a couple months pass, on December 19, 2003 Laci&rsquo;s mother, Sharon Rocha sues Scott for over five million dollars for the death of her daughter and unborn grandchild. But as of April of 2009, Sharon dropped the lawsuit against Scott Peterson.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott and Amber</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Not only did Scott killed his wife Laci, but he also had an affair. Scott went on a blind date with Amber Frey, a Fresno massage therapist, on November 20, 2002. Amber&rsquo;s best friend met Scott before they even went out and thought Scott was perfect for her. On their date Scott told Amber that he was not married, no children, and single. She felt that he was truly a </span><span class="c3">genuine guy</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;even though he was extremely nervous to meet her. She said that he insisted going to his hotel first instead of going to dinner. Later they went to a japanese restaurant where Scott arranged a private room for them so they can speak. Scott told her that he sold farm fertilizer for a company in Spain. This would mean that he would be traveling constantly and because he travels a lot that means he never had time to settle down. He told Amber that he was living in Sacramento and own a condo in San Diego. Amber took all of that information as the truth she didn&rsquo;t know that he was lying about living in Sacramento and owning a condo. The next time she saw scott was the 2 of December when he said that he was passing through Fresno. He enter Amber&rsquo;s house where he meet Amber&rsquo;s two year old daughter Ayiana. Scott had a special day planned for the both for them. He took them hiking and cooked them dinner. Amber then was talking how it is so much better to tell someone the truth, than a lie even if it&rsquo;s hard. She explained that even a tiny lie leads to mistrust and once a trust is broken it&rsquo;s difficult to build that relationship. In responsible to that statement Scott said &ldquo;I agree with you&rdquo;(Amber 1). On December 9 was the day that Amber found out that he was married because he ask her if she was home so they can talk about something. Scott then enter her house and started talking nonsense. He said to her &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">I haven&#39;t been completely honest with you, I lost my wife&rdquo;(Amber1). Amber was so supported that she wasn&rsquo;t angry at S</span><span class="c3">cott even though he lie about having a wife. He explained to her that he was sorry about lying to her before and that it was just too painful to talk about the loss of his wife. But that was a lie too because his wife was alive and eight-months pregnant. This was just another one of his lies. That same day he told Amber that he loss is wife he&rsquo;d brought a second fishing boat. This piece would eventually become the main key in the murder case. After five days, Scott continue to live a secret life and took Amber to a dance. As he was dancing with Amber, his wife was 100 miles away in Modesto attending a christmas party by herself. But he told her that there was a business trip he had to go to. Scott spend the night with Amber. The following day he told her that he was going on a long trip to Maine for the holidays with his parents then to Europe to celebrate New Years and do some business. But this is just an excuse to see his wife, Laci. Amber never suspected that he was going to see someone else until she ask where she could send him a christmas gift. Scott had given Amber a post office box in Modesto, about 80 miles away from Sacramento, where he said he lived. Amber felt so heartbroken and said &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">It was just really the first time that I felt things weren&#39;t sounding right&rdquo; (Amber 1). Over the next fews days, Scott has been calling Amber and lying about where he is constantly. For example Scott told her that he was at Maine, hunting ducks with his father on december 23. But the truth was that Laci had taken him to get a pre-christmas haircut near Modesto that day. That night Amber went to sleep and woke up early in the morning because she said she had a terrible nightmare. A man was tickling her daughter so violently that the child couldn&#39;t breathe. Amber was thinking about the dream and said that is was a woman laughing. She was yelling at the woman to stop laughing, she can&rsquo;t breathe. That was the moment when she woke up because she was having difficulty breathing. After ponding about the woman she has convinced herself that is was Laci Peterson in her dreams. The morning of December 24, Christmas Eve the investigators believe that Scott did dumped Laci&rsquo;s body out of his new boat into water of the San Francisco Bay. Scott called Laci&rsquo;s parents to tell them that their daughter went missing. He said that she disappear when he went fishing. Amber thought that Scott was a plane that was suppose to cross the Atlantic to go to Paris. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She ask Scott where he was and he said he was still in New York. She was surprise he didn&rsquo;t leave by now. He was suppose to be on a plane that left this morning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She was starting to have doubts about Scott, she ask him if he had another girlfriend or wife he said no. She felt bad for not trusting him and was sorry for accusing him. Amber had a friend named Richard Byrd, who was a Fresno police officer. He offered to check Scott out. Amber was expecting the worst to find out that Scott was married. On December 29 she got an urgent phone call from her friend the officer. She received a call at 1:40 in the morning. Her friend Richard had given her a number which was the phone number to the Modesto police department. After she contact the officer she was told to record all of their conversations which would be the biggest evidence against Scott. At a point Amber thought that Scott was a gentlemen who turn out to be a murder. From that moment everything in her life would change. January 24 of 2003, Amber went to the police news conference and told them she was having an affair with Scott. Scott was arrested at the Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego and is pending double homicide charge. &nbsp;At the time of his arrest, Peterson had colored his hair blonde, grown a beard and mustache, and was carrying 15 thousand dollars in cash. During his arrest police also discovered that Peterson&rsquo;s car was full of camping and survival equipment. On November 12, 2004 he was found guilty of first degree charge of his wife Laci but also receive a second degree murder of his son, Conner. A first degree murder would </span><span class="c3">potentially be a sentence of twenty-five years in prison. A second degree murder would be an estimate of a fifth years sentence in jail. Scott then was sentenced to </span><span class="c3">death by the jury on December 13, 2004. The love Scott felt for Amber would be consider a motive for killing his wife. He still continue his relationship with Amber even after Laci&rsquo;s disappearance. But Amber thought to differ, she decided that they shouldn&rsquo;t talk or contact each other until the case of his wife was solved. Now Scott is waiting on the death row and living a comfortable life paid by taxpayer money. According to </span><span class="c3">Nancy Mullane, the award-winning author of </span><span class="c3">&quot;Life After Murder: Five Men In Search of Redemption&rdquo; said, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">They are not having the life Scott Peterson is having. Scott Peterson has an exclusive life inside San Quentin&rdquo;. She is referring to the other prisoner&rsquo;s life how they are not similar to Scott. Some prisoner don&rsquo;t get to go outside they are just stuck in their cell. Scott is having a good time in prison, and not caring for the death of his family.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Work Cited </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Editor, Biography.com. &quot;Scott Peterson Biography.&quot; </span><span class="c3 c8">Bio.com</span><span class="c0">.
